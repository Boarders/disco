This project will produce four types of deliverables: the source code
of the \thelang{} environment, curricular modules, study results, and
tutorials.  All source code from this project will be open source and
hosted publicly on Github\footnote{\url{http://www.github.com}}.
Haskell libraries developed as part of this project will also be
distributed via
Hackage\footnote{\url{http://www.hackage.haskell.org}}, the Haskell
community's central repository of open source Haskell software.

\thelang{}'s design, the course curriculum, and the study results
will be disseminated through academic conferences, workshops, and
journals.  Potential venues include the Special Interest Group on
Computer Science Education (SIGCSE), the ACM SIGPLAN International
Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), the workshop on Trends in
Functional Programming in Education (TFPiE), and the Journal of
Functional Programming.

Informal tutorials will be constructed outlining how to put the
results of this project into practice for faculty teaching discrete
mathematics.  These tutorials will be disseminated through the PI's
blogs, and/or through hosted workshops at computer science conferences
or the PI's universities.
