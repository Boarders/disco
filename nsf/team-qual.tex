Harley Eades has extensive experience designing and analyzing both
simply typed and dependently typed programming languages and
logics. As part of his dissertation Harley Eades was a member of the
Trellys project \cite{Kimmel:2013,Sjoberg:2012} in which he
contributed to the design of a dependently typed functional
programming language called Separation of Proof from Program (Sep3)
whose design is now detailed in his dissertation
\cite{Eades:2014b,Kimmel:2013}. The second major part of his
dissertation was dedicated to the meta-theoretic analysis of various
type theories. First, he studied a new proof technique for proving
normalization of simply typed and predicative polymorphic type
theories called hereditary substitution, and then proved completeness
of a new logic and simple type theory called dualized simple type
theory \cite{Eades:2014b}.

Since graduate school Harley Eades transitioned into an assistant
professor position at Augusta University where he teaches discrete
mathematics, theory of computation, and programming language
concepts. His research is now focused on the design and meta-theoretic
analysis of programming languages based on linear logic for verifying
security critical systems.  He was awarded a NSF Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Research Initiation
Initiative (CRII) grant to develop a new domain-specific functional
programming language for conducting threat analysis (Grant
No. 1565557).

The second co-PI, Brent Yorgey, has experience in both functional
programming and mathematics education.  He is well-known in the
Haskell functional programming language community for his educational
materials, such as the \emph{Typeclassopedia} \cite{Typeclassopedia},
and his course materials for an undergraduate introductory Haskell
course developed at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which are
routinely recommended by the community as some of the best materials
for learning functional programming in Haskell \cite{bitemyapp-learn}.
Yorgey's blog, \emph{The Math Less Traveled} \cite{yorgey-tmlt}, explains
discrete mathematics topics to a broad audience and attracts around
10,000 unique visitors each month.

Yorgey is also the lead developer of \emph{diagrams} \cite{diagrams}, a
high-level framework for creating vector graphics, which will be used
as the basis for visualizations in the \thelang environment.
