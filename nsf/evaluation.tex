The evaluation of this project will occur during the second and third
year of this project and can be broken down into two phases.  In each
phase our main data collection format will be surveys.  All surveys
used in this project will be professional created for education by the
Augusta University survey team.

\textbf{Phase One.} The PI Harley Eades has taught discrete
mathematics to computer science students twice a year for over two
years and has identified many of the topics his students struggle with
each semester.  In this phase he will adopt the curriculum created by
this project.  Following its adoption data will be collected on
student performance on quizzes and exams, and then at the end of the
semester students will be surveyed on how they thought the \thelang{}
environment helped them throughout the semester.

The Hendrix College Mathematics and Computer Science department
teaches discrete mathematics to a mixture of mathematics and computer
science students.  In addition, the course is generally taught by a
mathematician rather than a computer scientist.  In Phase One their
course will adopt the curriculum created by this project as well.
Their students will be similarly evaluated.  Furthermore, we will
survey the instructor to obtain data on the effectiveness of this
projects adoption by faculty with little computer science background.

\textbf{Phase two.} As part of this proposal we are asking for funds
to recruit discrete mathematics instructors external to our
universities to pilot the curriculum developed by this project. We
will then use surveys to collect data from each of our external
recruits.
