Game plan for *incrementally* generalizing operators.  Goals:

- Support writing things like _+_ so operators parse as independent
  terms, so they can be used as arguments to higher-order functions,
  partially applied, etc.

- Simplify representation & type checking so we no longer have special
  TBin and TUn nodes, just application.

- Ultimately I want to do this now (as opposed to waiting until later)
  because I want to be able to define infix operators like 'union',
  'intersection', etc. in a library (in terms of the 'merge' prim).

I tried to do it all at once and failed; once I finally got it to
compile there were tons of errors in the test suite etc. and I was
completely at a loss as to what was going on.  This time I think I
will try a more incremental approach, i.e. try to keep it building and
passing tests as much as possible.

- Leave TBin, TUn intact at first
- [X] Add operators as prims
- [ ] Add parsing rules for standalone operators & test parsing
- [ ] Add typing rule for one standalone operator (e.g. _+_) and get it to typecheck
- [ ] Add desugaring and compilation rules for _+_
- [ ] Switch parsing of normal infix + to produce TApp node

- Then convert other operators
