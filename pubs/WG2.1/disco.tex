  \end{itemize}

\begin{xframe}{Context}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<+-> I teach at a small undergraduate institution
  \item<+-> Want to introduce strongly typed FP to students early

\section{Design principles}

\note{With this context in mind, let me tell you the core design
  principles of disco.}

\begin{xframe}
  \begin{center}
    {\Large \#1} \bigskip

    {\Large Elegant, strong static type system}
  \end{center}
\note{First, the language needs to have a well-designed, strong,
  static type system.  I want students to see the beauty and utility
  of thinking with types, and learn general principles that they can
  transfer to other languages.}

\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}
  \begin{center}
    {\Large \#2} \bigskip

    {\Large Usable by beginning programmers}
  \end{center}
  \note{Some of the students taking the course will have taken an
    introductory programming course, but it shouldn't have programming
    as a prerequisite.}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}
  \begin{center}
    {\Large \#3} \bigskip

    {\Large Syntax and semantics inspired by mathematical practice}
  \end{center}

  \note{As much as possible, I want to close the gap between the
    mathematics the students are learning in the class and the kinds
    of things they can talk about in the language.  I also want to
    make it attractive/possible for mathematics faculty to be able to
    pick it up quickly.}
\end{xframe}

\section{Type System}

\note{OK, so let's talk about some interesting design choices
  underlying disco's type system.}

\begin{xframe}{Polymorphism}
  disco has standard parametric polymorphism:
\begin{verbatim}
maplist : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
maplist _ []        = []
maplist f (a :: as) = f a :: maplist f as
\end{verbatim}
  \note{First, disco has standard parametric polymorphism.  For
    example, here's an implementation of a standard map function (I
    didn't call it 'map' because that's a built-in primitive---more on
    that later).  You can see the syntax is very Haskell-like, except
    \texttt{:} and \texttt{::} are switched, and we use \texttt{List}
    instead of square brackets (the pun between value-level and
    type-level square brackets in Haskell is confusing for students).

    There's not much interesting to say about this; just keep it in
    mind.}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \Huge
  \begin{overprint}
    \onslide<2> \[ \mathbb{N} \]
    \onslide<3> \[ \mathbb{N} \qquad \mathbb{Z} \]
    \onslide<4> \[ \mathbb{N} \stackrel{\small ?}{\leq} \mathbb{Z} \]
  \end{overprint}
  \note{Now, what base types should we include?  Well, any language
    for FP and discrete math obviously has to start with the natural
    numbers as a built-in base type!  And then we quickly want
    negative numbers too, so we add an integer type.  But then we
    immediately run head-on into the issue of subtyping. Do we want N
    to be a subtype of Z?}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \Huge
  \[ \mathbb{N} \leq \mathbb{Z} \] \note{Based on principle \#3, I
    would argue that yes, we have to!  Every math student knows that
    natural numbers are A SUBSET OF the integers.  It would be very
    jarring to be required to apply some sort of explicit conversion
    function.

    So we need subtyping in the language.  We'll come back to this.}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \begin{overprint}
    \onslide<1>
    \begin{center}
      \begin{diagram}[width=75]
      dia = mconcat
        [ mconcat
          [ circle 2
          , hrule 4 # rotateBy (1/8)
          ]
          # lw none
        , text "$\\mathbb{R}$?"
        ]
      \end{diagram}
    \end{center}
    \onslide<2>
    \begin{center}
    \begin{diagram}[width=75]
      dia = mconcat
        [ mconcat
          [ circle 2
          , hrule 4 # rotateBy (1/8)
          ]
          # lc red lwL 0.4
        , text "$\\mathbb{R}$"
        ]
    \end{diagram}
    \end{center}
  \end{overprint}
  \note{You might think the next base type we want is some sort of
    floating-point type. But we definitely don't.  Floating point
    numbers suck, and we don't need them for discrete math!}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \Huge
  \[ \mathbb{N} \leq \mathbb{Z} \leq \mathbb{Q} \]
  \note{Instead, we make rational numbers built-in first-class
    citizens, so we can have division.  And then after a while of
    working with this, I had a sudden epiphany that there's a fourth
    type we want to add.  Does anyone know what I'm going to say?
    Maybe others have already thought about this?}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \Large
  \[ \mathbb{F} = \left\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{N}, b \neq 0 \right\} \]
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Base types}
  \begin{center}
    % IFTIME: make this diagram nicer
  \begin{diagram}[width=100]
    baseSquare = square 6 # rotateBy (-1/8)

    lattice = mconcat (zipWith moveTo baseSquare baseTyDias)
      # connect' opts "N" "Z"
      # connect' opts "N" "F"
      # connect' opts "F" "Q"
      # connect' opts "Z" "Q"

    opts = with & gaps .~ local 1.3 & headLength .~ local 0.6

    dia = lattice

    baseTys = ["N", "Z", "Q", "F"]
    mkBaseTyDia ty = mconcat
      [ text ("$\\mathbb{" ++ ty ++ "}$")
      , square 1 # lw none
      ]
      # named ty
    baseTyDias = map mkBaseTyDia baseTys
  \end{diagram}
  \end{center}
  \note{Now we get this lovely subtyping lattice.  $\mathbb{N}$
    supports addition and multiplication.  Moving up and to the right
    corresponds to having additive inverses; up and left is
    multiplicative inverses. We can go back down with absolute value
    or with floor/ceiling.}
  % XXX if time, add more info to the picture
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}
  \begin{center}
    {\Huge Demo!}
  \end{center}
  \note{Do a quick demo.  Show basic arithmetic operations and
    inferring their types. Show division and rationals. Show inferring
    the type of lists containing all naturals, negative, fraction, or
    both.  Show how this lets us e.g. be precise about the type of
    exponentiation, $2^5$, $(-2)^5$, $2^{-5}$, $(-2)^{-5}$.}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Quiz}
  \begin{center}
    Q: What should be the type of $\lambda x. x - 1$?
  \end{center}

  \onslide<2>
  A: it can be $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Q} \to
  \mathbb{Q}$, \emph{but} neither is a subtype the other.

  \note{Show what disco does here: it reports $Z \to Z$ but it's also
    OK with applying it to a rational.  But if we assign it to a
    variable we now can't apply it to a rational.  What's going on?}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Qualified types}

  \[ \lambda x. x - 1 : \forall \alpha. \text{sub } \alpha \Rightarrow
    \alpha \to \alpha \]

  \onslide<2->
  \begin{center}
    \dots but we don't want students to see this!
  \end{center}
  \note{Qualifiers are generated and used under the hood.  Similar to
    type classes in Haskell. But always monomorphized away before
    showing the user.}
\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Yikes}
    \begin{overprint}
      \onslide<1>
      \begin{center}
        Qualified polymorphism + subtyping $\to$ yikes. \bigskip
      \end{center}
    \onslide<2->
    \begin{center}
      Qualified polymorphism + \textcolor{red}{structural} subtyping
      is just barely tractable!
    \end{center}
    \end{overprint}

\end{xframe}

\begin{xframe}{Equirecursive types}
\begin{verbatim}
type T = Unit + Nat * T * T

foldT : r -> (N -> r -> r -> r) -> T -> r
foldT x f (left  ())      = x
foldT x f (right (n,l,r)) = f n (foldT x f l) (foldT x f r)

sumT : T -> N
sumT = foldT 0 (\x l r. x + l + r)
\end{verbatim}

  \note{Let me just mention that disco also has equirecursive types.
    We can get away with this because unlike Haskell, we don't care
    too much about inference---for both practical and pedagogical
    reasons, a type signature is required on every top-level
    binding. (And for now at least, top-level bindings are the only
    ones allowed to be recursive.) I'm excited about this because I
    think it will work well pedagogically: you can first spend some
    time talking about sums and products of types and their
    corresponding combinatorial interpretations (disco can count and
    enumerate all members of a given type), and then simply build
    recursive data types directly out of sums and products, without
    having to introduce constructors, which in my experience students
    often find confusing.}

\section{Randomness}

\note{It would be nice to be able to have randomness.  But there are
  several constraints and I haven't yet found a satisfactory way to
  navigate the tradeoffs.}

\begin{xframe}{Constraints}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<+-> Would like the types to reflect whether randomness is
    present.  Don't just want to give the whole language
    nondeterministic semantics.
  \item<+-> Don't want to make students use a monad!
  \item<+-> Did I mention the language is lazy?
