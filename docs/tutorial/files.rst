Disco files and the disco REPL
******************************

For anything beyond simple one-off calculations that can be entered at
the disco prompt, disco definitions may be stored in a file which can
be loaded into the REPL.  Disco files typically end in ``.disco``.
Here is a simple example:

.. literalinclude:: code/example.disco


* Putting definitions in a file, with (required!) type signatures
* ``:load``
* Comment syntax
* Documentation syntax, ``:doc`` command
* Other commands
