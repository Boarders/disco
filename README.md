Prototype implementation of a small functional teaching language
for use in a discrete mathematics course.

Design principles:

* Includes those features, and *only* those features, useful in the
  context of a discrete math course. This is *not* intended to be a
  general-purpose language.
* Syntax is as close to standard *mathematical* practice as possible.
* Tooling, error messages, etc. are very important---the language
  needs to be accessible to undergrads with no prior programming
  experience.

Feel free to look around, ask questions, etc.  You can even contribute
some code if you like---collaborators are most welcome.  However, note
that no guarantees are made about anything in particular at the
moment.
